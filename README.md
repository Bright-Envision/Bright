Bright JavaScript Library.
----

HTML5 focused Library... this will only work in ie9+ in some of the next versions

So at the moment it has 
<ul>
  <li> AJAX </li>
  <li> Animations </li>
  <li> Some UI elements </li>
  <li> Works with IE 8+, Chrome 3+ firefox 3+ and safari 3+ </li>
</ul>

I'll be putting up a website for it later, this month... (a bit busy) 



The Selectors are very simular to jQuerys ones... so for example
<pre><code>bright("#id").toggle();</code></pre>


This is how we select and work with some of the functions...

---

Develop branch, this means that these files are stil being developed on aka experimental and may not even get to final release... these functions are undocumented and without any guides...


It will help people building html5 app's/websites as it will have a lot of wrappers around some javascript html5 features that have tonnes of prefixing
