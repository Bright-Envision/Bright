Bright JavaScript Library.
======

This is my brand new library that I named "Bright".

This is a Library that is very simular to jQuery and has tonnes of functions that are in jQuery. This will eventualy turn in
to the Bright framework, but at the moment, its just the Bright Library. 


So at the moment it has 
<ul>
  <li> AJAX </li>
  <li> Animations </li>
  <li> Some UI elements </li>
  <li> Works with IE 8+, Chrome 3+ firefox 3+ and safari 3+ </li>
</ul>

I'll be putting up a website for it later, this month... (a bit busy) 



The Selectors are very simular to jQuerys ones... so for example
<pre><code>bright("#id").toggle();</code></pre>


This is how we select and work with some of the functions...
