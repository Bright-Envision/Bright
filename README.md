Bright JavaScript Library.
======

This is my brand new library that I named "Bright".

This is a Library that is very simular to jQuery and has tonnes of functions that are in jQuery. This will eventualy turn in
to the Bright framework, but at the moment, its just the Bright Library. 


<b>Plans:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Real Time </li>
  <li> Framework </li>
  <li> socketIO intergration </li>
  <li> Alot more work with functions </li>
</ul>

So at the moment it has 
<ul>
  <li> AJAX </li>
  <li> Animations </li>
  <li> Some UI elements </li>
  <li> Works with IE 8+, Chrome 3+ firefox 3+ and safari 3+ </li>
</ul>

I'll be putting up a website for it later, this month... (a bit busy) 



The Selectors are very simular to jQuerys ones... so for example
<pre><code>bright("#id").toggle();</code></pre>


This is how we select and work with some of the functions...
=======
----

Develop branch, this means that these files are stil being developed on aka experimental and may not even get to final release... these functions are undocumented and without any guides...


It will help people building html5 app's/websites as it will have a lot of wrappers around some javascript html5 features that have tonnes of prefixing
